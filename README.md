## Problem Definition:
The low inventory and high competition in the Seattle housing market make it difficult for homebuyers to find a place to call home. Increasing single-family home prices have resulted from a widespread housing boom fueled by historically low-interest rates and a scarcity of available properties, making homeownership out of reach for more people. As more millennials enter the market, the demand crunch will intensify. From the supply and demand standpoint, Seattle's housing market is currently one of the most inequitably balanced in the United States. Many homes get multiple offers, some with waived contingencies.

There's not enough supply to keep up. Growing demand is expected to continue due to a lack of new construction entering the market in suburban areas following years of underdevelopment. With interest rates remaining at historically low levels and a supply of homes available for sale in the region of less than one month, the perfect storm for rising house prices will continue, albeit perhaps not quite as ferociously as previously.

What you get to see are record-breaking housing prices and record-breaking low inventory. Seattle's housing market is driven by employees of local tech businesses like Amazon and Microsoft and corporations with significant operations in the vicinity like Google and Facebook. Many of them didn't want to work remotely in small apartments during the epidemic, so they sought spacious homes with office areas. Most of them have the financial means to compete with other buyers and raise home selling prices.

What opportunities exist to create a predictive pricing model for a Seattle housing market home when given known features and square footage?
